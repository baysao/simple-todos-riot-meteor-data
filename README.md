# Simple Todo List demo for Riot Meteor

Modify from [meteor-todo](https://github.com/meteor/simple-todos)

The Meteor Tutorial app.

Use it to share a single todo list with your friends. The list updates on everyone's screen in real time, and you can make tasks private if you don't want others to see them.

Learn how to build this app by following the [Meteor Tutorial](http://www.meteor.com/install).
